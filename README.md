# Myntra-weforshe-
This project was developed as part of the Myntra "We for She" hackathon, focusing on innovative solutions to enhance user engagement and promote sustainability in the fashion ecosystem. Our team successfully advanced to the third round, showcasing three key features: Myntra Thrift, SwipFit, and Reel.

Buy, sell, or donate clothes in a simple and intuitive way.
Donate clothes by submitting an online request for pickup, after which the items are collected from the user's location.
Earn rewards in the form of cash points for donated items.
By encouraging users to contribute to a more sustainable fashion ecosystem, Myntra Thrift addresses both consumer needs and environmental concerns.
